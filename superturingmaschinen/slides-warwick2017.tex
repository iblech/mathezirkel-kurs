  \begin{itemize}
    \item Turing machines are idealised computers operating on an \hil{infinite
    tape} according to a \hil{finite list} of rules.
    \item The concept is astoundingly robust.
    \item A subset of~$\NN$ is \hil{enumerable by a Turing machine} if and only
    if it's a $\Sigma_1$-set.

\note{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item\justifying There are explicit examples for Turing machines with a
    very small number of states for which their halting behaviour is unknown.
    There are orther examples for which their halting behaviour is independent
    of standard Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory.

    \item Besides Turing machines, there are alternative models for
    computation, for instance lambda calculus and register machines. For
    functions~$\NN \to \NN$, these models all yield the same notion of
    computabitility. For higher-order functions, where the domain is a set of
    functions, the models typically differ in which functions they deem
    computable.
  \end{itemize}
}

\note{\begin{itemize}
  \item\justifying A set~$M \subseteq \NN$ is \emph{enumerable by a Turing
  machines} (or \emph{recursively enumerable}) if and only if there is a Turing
  machine which outputs all the elements of~$M$ (in an arbitrary order, using
  some fixed encoding).

  \item A set~$M \subseteq \NN$ is a~$\Sigma_1$-set if and only if there is
  a~$\Sigma_1$-formula~$\varphi$ of first-order arithmetic containing exactly one free
  variable such that $M = \{ n \in \NN \,|\, \varphi(n) \}$.
  A formula~$\varphi$ is a~$\Sigma_1$-formula if and only if it is of the form
  \[ \exists m_1\_ \exists m_2\_ \ldots \exists m_k\_ \heartsuit, \]
  where the existential quantifiers range over the natural numbers and no
  further unbounded quantifiers (of any kind) may appear in the
  subformula~$\heartsuit$.
\end{itemize}}

\note{\justifying
  There is also a deep link between computability and number
  theory: A set~$M \subseteq \NN$ is enumerable by a Turing machine if and only
  if it is a \emph{diophantine set}, that is of the form
  \[ M = \{ n \in \NN \,|\, \text{the eq.\@ $f(n,x_1,\ldots,x_m) = 0$
  has a solution} \}, \]
  where $f$ is a polynomial with integral coefficients and ``solution'' means
  integral solution.

  topos~$\Set$.
  \bigskip

  One can even employ machines of the real physical world as the

\begin{frame}{What's true in alternate toposes?}
  \hil{Metatheorem:} If a statement has a \hil{constructive proof},
  then it holds in \hil{any topos}.
  \bigskip

  Constructive logic is like classical logic, except we don't suppose the
  \hil{law of excluded middle} (LEM), which says:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ``Any statement is either true or not true.''
    \item ``If a statement is \emph{not not} true, then it's true.''
  \end{itemize}

  \bigskip\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{lem}
  \par
\end{frame}

\note{\begin{itemize}
  \item\justifying The technical term for ``constructive logic'' is
  ``intuitionistic logic''. ``Constructive logic'' or even ``constructive
  mathematics'' is more of an umbrella term which might mean any of several
  related, but not equivalent systems.

  \item The law of excluded middle is the axiom which allows us to
  argue by contradiction. But the word ``contradiction'' is still allowed in
  constructive mathematics; see below.

  \item The proof of the metatheorem is constructive.
\end{itemize}}


\subsubsection{Nonconstructive proofs}

\begin{frame}{Nonconstructive proofs}

  {\centering\includegraphics[scale=0.20]{pythagoras}\par}

  \hil{Theorem.} There are \hil{irrational} numbers~$x$ und~$y$ such that~$x^y$ is rational.
  \medskip

  \pause
  \hil{Proof.} Either~$\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational or not.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item In the first case we are done.
    \item In the second case we set~$x \defeq \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and~$y \defeq
    \sqrt{2}$. Then~$x^y = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} =
    \sqrt{2}^2 = 2$ is rational.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\note{\justifying
  The proof is nice and short. However, after having seen the proof, we are still not able
  to give an example of irrational numbers~$x,y$ such that~$x^y$ is rational!
  The proof was \emph{non-constructive}. If we want to extract explicit
  witnesses from the proof, the proof has to be constructive, such as this one:

  \begin{quote}Set~$x \defeq \sqrt{2}$ and~$y \defeq \log_{\sqrt{2}} 3$.
  Then~$x^y = 3$ is rational. The proof that~$y$ is irrational is even easier
  than the proof that~$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.\end{quote}

  It turns out that from all the axioms of classical logic, exactly one is
  responsible for non-constructivity: the law of excluded middle.
  \par
}


\subsubsection[Praise]{Appreciating constructive logic}

\begin{frame}{Appreciating constructive logic}
  At first sight, dropping the law of excluded middle looks like a sad thing
  to do. It's a useful axiom! However:

  \begin{itemize}\justifying
    \item The axiom is not needed as often as one would think.
    \item The abstinence is good for your mental hygiene.
    \item Constructive logic allows for finer distinctions.
    \item From constructive proofs one can mechanically extract programs which
    witness the proved statements.
    \item \hil{Dropping the law of excluded middle allows to add curious unconvential axioms.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note{\justifying
  We're used to immediately cancel double negations. Since that's
  constructively not possible, we have to exercise a bit of linguistic
  caution:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item\justifying
  \emph{Proof of a negated statement (constructively acceptable):}
  We want to verify~$\neg\psi$. Assume that~$\psi$ holds. Then \ldots,
  that's a contradiction. Therefore~$\neg\psi$.

  This is a constructively valid argument, since in constructive (and
  classical) logic~$\neg\psi$ is defined as the implication~$(\psi \Rightarrow
  \bot)$, where~$\bot$ is the formal logical symbol for falsity, a
  contradiction.

  \item \emph{Proof by contradiction (constructively not acceptable a priori):}
  We want to verify~$\varphi$. Assume that~$\varphi$ is false. Then \ldots,
  that's a contradiction. Therefore~$\varphi$ holds.

  The constructively valid part of this argument only shows that~$\varphi$ does
  \emph{not not} hold: $\neg\neg\varphi$.\par

\note{\justifying
  Several years ago a video showing Kate Moss consuming drugs surfaced. From
  the video it was clear that the drugs were either of some type~$A$ or of some
  type~$B$, but there was no direct evidence for either type. Kate Moss was
  not prosecuted; in this sense, the judicial system operated on
  constructive logic. Check out

\note{\justifying
  Constructive logic allows for finer distictions than classical logic.
  For instance, if we know that the key to our apartment has to be somewhere in
  the apartment (since we used it to enter last night) but we can't find it
  right now, we can constructively only justify
  \[ \neg\neg( \exists x\_ \text{the key is at position $x$} ), \]
  not the stronger statement
  \[ \phantom{\neg\neg(} \exists x\_ \text{the key is at position
  $x$},\phantom{)} \]
  because for justifying the stronger statement we'd had to give an explicit
  witness of the existential statement (the position of the key).

  (Both examples do not quite work, since constructive mathematics is (like
  classical mathematics) indifferent to our personal state of knowledge.)
  \par
}

\note{\justifying
  Constructive mathematicians do \emph{not} claim that the law of excluded
  middle is false (that is, that its negation holds). In fact, some instances
  of the law of excluded middle are true intuitionistically: For example one
  can show by induction that any natural number is zero or is not zero.
  Constructive mathematicians simply don't suppose that the law of excluded
  holds generally.
  \bigskip

  The analogous statement about real numbers does not have a constructive
  proof. This is linked with a familiar fact from programming: It's unbeseeming
  to compare floating point numbers for equality, while there is no such
  problem with comparing integers.

\note{\justifying
  Philosophers don't only study what's \emph{true}, but also what \emph{should
  be true}, what's \emph{possible}, what's \emph{necessary}, what
  somebody \emph{knows} or somebody \emph{believes}. This is formalised using
  \emph{modal operators}.
  \bigskip

  Mathematicians don't need to envy that greater scope: In constructive
  mathematics there is too a multitude of modal operators. Double negation is
  the most prominent example.\bigskip

  oracle in the real world? A machine which reads the description of a Turing
  machine and then outputs whether the Turing machine halts or not?
  \bigskip

  Since this is not about the halting problem for machines of the real world
  (which is not decidable by machines of the real world, by the
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem}{usual argument}), but
  only about the halting problem for Turing machines, the answer \emph{might}
  be ``yes''. Tricks using black holes and relativistic time dilation might
  be possible.\bigskip

\note{\justifying
  \scriptsize
  A good way to convince oneself that the axiom of choice is indeed a
  nontrivial statement is to look at what the statement ``$\NN^\NN$ is
  projective'' means in~$\Eff(\TM)$. It means that
  \begin{center}\parbox{0.86\textwidth}{
    There is a Turing machine~$M$, which reads the description of a Turing
    machine~$P$, which computes a function~$f : \NN \to \NN$, as input, and
    outputs an element~$M(P) \in Y$ together with a witness
    of~$\varphi(f,M(P))$.
  }\end{center}
  implies
  \begin{center}\parbox{0.86\textwidth}{
    There is a computable map~$g$ from the set of computable maps~$f : \NN \to
    \NN$ to the set~$Y$ such that for all such functions~$f$ the
    statement~$\varphi(f,g(f))$ holds in~$\Eff(\TM)$.
  }\end{center}

  On first sight, this implications seems to be true:
  It seems that one could define the looked-for map~$g$ to be simply the map computed by~$M$.
  But that doesn't necessarily work: If~$f : \NN \to \NN$ is a map which is computed
  by a Turing machine~$P$, then the element~$M(P)$ might depend on the concrete
  realisation of~$f$ by the machine~$P$. Different implementations of~$f$ by
  different Turing machines~$P'$ might yield different elements~$M(P')$.
  Therefore the resulting ``map''~$g$ might be multi-valued, so not a proper
  map.

\note{\justifying
  The statement ``any function~$\NN \to \NN$ is computable by a Turing

  standard topos~$\Set$.
  \bigskip

  The meaning of the formal Church--Turing thesis in~$\Eff(\STM)$ is: ``There
  is a super Turing machine which reads the source of a super Turing machine
  computing a function~$f : \NN \to \NN$ as input and outputs the source of an
  \emph{ordinary} Turing machine which computes~$f$.'' This is false.
  \bigskip

  The statement is also false in~$\Eff(\lambdaC)$, the ef{}fective topos
  associated to lambda calculus. This is because of different calling
  conventions; a higher-order lambda term has no access to the syntactic
  structure of a passed argument.
  \par
}

\note{\justifying
  Whether the formal Church--Turing thesis holds in~$\Eff(\RW)$, the
  ef{}fective topos associated to machines of the real world, depends on the
  nature of computation in the real world.\par
}

\note{\justifying
  The topos~$\Eff(\TM)$ is a nice context for computer science, since in it
  uncomputable functions are not present.
  By contrast, in classical mathematics, there are many functions which are not
  computable.  Two of the most famous ones are the ``halting predicate'' and
  the ``Busy Beaver function'':
  \begin{align*}
    H(n) &= \begin{cases}
      1, & \text{if the~$n$'th Turing machine halts,} \\
      0, & \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases} \\
    BB(n) &= \text{maximal number of steps which a halting Turing machine} \\
    &\qquad\quad\text{with $n$ states performs before halting.}
  \end{align*}
  Can't we use exactly the same definitions in the ef{}fective topos, thereby
  contradicting the theorem that all functions in the ef{}fective topos are
  computable?\par
}

\note{\justifying
  The apparent paradox is resolved in the following way. The theorem only states
  that total functions~$\NN \to \NN$ are computable. However, to verify
  that~$H$ and~$BB$ are indeed such total functions, the law of excluded middle
  is necessary:
  \bigskip

  For~$H$, in order to be able to make the case distinction.
  \bigskip

  For~$BB$, because implicitly the lemma that a ``subfinite'' set of natural
  numbers contains a maximal element was used. This lemma depends on the law of
  excluded middle.\par

\subsubsection[Cont.\@]{Automatic continuity}

\begin{frame}{Automatic continuity}
  \justifying
  The following statement is wildly \hil{false} in~$\Set$:
  \[ \text{``Every function $f : \RR \to \RR$ is continuous.''} \]
  A function~$f$ is \hil{continuous} if and only if, for calculating~$f(x)$ to
  finitely many digits, finitely many digits of~$x$ suffice.\par

  \hil{True} in $\Eff(\TM)$. \pause
  True in~$\Eff(\RW)$, if private communication channels are possible and
  only finitely many computational steps can be executed in finite time.\par
\end{frame}

\note{\justifying
  Don't there obviously exist discontinuous functions? Like the sign function?
  \[ \mathrm{sgn} : \RR \to \RR, \quad
    x \mapsto \begin{cases}
      -1, & \text{if $x < 0$,} \\
      0,  & \text{if $x = 0$,} \\
      1,  & \text{if $x > 0$.}
    \end{cases}
  \]
  Without the presence of the law of excluded middle, the situation is not so
  trivial: Without LEM, one cannot show that this rule
  defines a total function~$\RR \to \RR$, because without LEM, the lemma
  ``every real number is either $< 0$, $= 0$, or $> 0$'' can't be shown.
  (This lemma implies the weaker statement that any real number is either zero
  or not zero. We've already seen that this statement is false in~$\Eff(\TM)$.)
  \medskip

  Without LEM, the rule only defines a function~$M \to \RR$, where~$M =
  \{ x \in \RR \,|\, x < 0 \vee x = 0 \vee x > 0 \}$.
  \par
}

\note{\justifying
  The real numbers can be constructed in several different ways, for instance
  using Cauchy sequences or Dedekind cuts. Because the axiom of dependent
  choice holds in~$\Eff(\TM)$,~$\Eff(\STM)$, and~$\Eff(\RW)$, all those
  constructions coincide.\bigskip

  Externally, a real number in any of these toposes is given by a machine which
  produces coherent, arbitrarily good approximations. For instance, one could
  ask such a machine for approximations which are correct to three, seven, or
  ten digits and obtain the answers
  \[ 3.1417777777, \quad 3.1415926777, \quad\text{and}\quad 3.1415926535. \]
  Machines which compute different, but equally good approximations represent
  the same real number.\par

  The fine print: By ``correct to~$n$ digits'' we mean ``distance at
  most~$10^{-n}$ to the true value''. We don't literally refer to the first~$n$
  digits after the decimal point (which aren't well-defined anyway,
  $0.999\ldots = 1$).
  \medskip

  For instance, the approximation~$0.999$ of the number~$1$ is correct to three
  digits while~$0.998$ is only correct to two digits.\par
}

\note{\justifying\scriptsize
  The meaning of the statement ``all functions~$\RR \to \RR$ are continuous''
  in the ef{}fective topos is: There is a machine~$M$ which takes

  \vspace{-1.2em}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item\justifying a machine~$A$ which computes a function~$f : \RR \to \RR$, \\[-1.4em]
    \item a machine~$X$ which represents a real number~$x$, and \\[-1.4em]
    \item a natural number~$n$
  \end{enumerate}
  \vspace{-1.2em}

  as inputs and outputs a natural number~$m$ with the following property:
  For any real number~$\tilde x$ which is the same as~$x$ to~$m$ digits,
  the numbers~$f(x)$ and~$f(\tilde x)$ are the same to~$n$ digits.\smallskip

  In the case of real world machines, one can proceed as follows to construct
  such a machine~$M$. Given~$A$,~$X$, and~$n$, the machine~$M$ should call~$A$
  with a slight variant~$X'$ of~$X$: The machine~$X'$ should exhibit the same
  input/output behaviour as~$X$, but on each call~$X'$ should tell~$M$ using a
  private communication channel how many digits were asked for. Since~$X'$ has
  the same input/output behaviour as~$X$, the machine~$A$ is bound by contract
  to react to~$X'$ in the same way as it reacts to~$X$.\smallskip

  If only finitely many computational steps can be performed in finite time,
  then~$M$ can determine a suitable number~$m$ as follows: It just
  has to wait till~$A$ has computed~$f(x)$ to~$n$ digits. It can then look at
  its log to see how many digits of~$x$ $A$ used for the computation. For any
  number~$\tilde x$ which is equal to~$x$ to this amount of digits, the
  number~$f(\tilde x)$ produced by~$A$ is the same as~$f(x)$ to~$n$ digits.\par
}

\note{\justifying
  Not a fan of real numbers? The same phenomenon is visible at other types, for
  instance for functions~$f : \BB^\NN \to \BB$, where~$\BB = \{ 0,1 \}$ as
  before. Such a function is continuous if and only if, for any~$x \in \BB^\NN$
  (that is, any function~$x : \NN \to \BB$) there exists a number~$m$ such
  that~$f(x)$ depends only on the first~$m$ values of~$x$.\bigskip

  In~$\Eff(\TM)$, the statement ``every function~$f : \BB^\NN \to \BB$'' is
  true.\par

  It's true that the underlying set of the object~$\NN^\NN$ of~$\Eff(\TM)$ is
  countable, so that there is a surjection (even bijection)~$\NN \to

  But any such surjection is either not computable, therefore not contained
  in~$\Eff(\TM)$, or is computable, but in a way that there is no computable
  witness of its surjectivity. Therefore~$\NN^\NN$ looks like an uncountable
